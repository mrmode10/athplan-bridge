### PROJECT: Athplan Bridge (Backend)
### SESSION STATE: 2026-01-20 | Build Status: SUCCESS (0 Vulnerabilities)

## 1. ARCHITECTURAL TRUTHS (IMMUTABLE)
- Entry File: dist/app.js (Compiled from src/app.ts)
- Port Logic: Must use process.env.PORT || 3000 (Hostinger dynamic port)
- DB Auth: Supabase via Service Role Key (Bypasses RLS for bridge logging)
- Env Loading: 'dotenv/config' MUST stay as Line 1 in app.ts

## 2. COMPLETED MILESTONES
- [x] Phase 1: TypeScript build pipeline (tsc) configured and verified.
- [x] Phase 2: Production Hardening (Commit c81e4331).
- [x] Phase 2: Health endpoint (/health) validates Supabase connectivity.
- [x] Phase 2: Dependency audit (0 vulnerabilities found).

## 3. ACTIVE TASKS (PHASE 3)
- [ ] Push hardened build to GitHub 'main' branch.
- [ ] Configure Hostinger hPanel for Managed Node.js deployment.
- [ ] Verify Live Webhook Handshake: Twilio -> Bridge -> Voiceflow.

## 4. DEPLOYMENT CONFIG (HOSTINGER 2026)
- Build Command: npm run build
- Entry File: dist/app.js
- Env Vars: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY (service_role), VOICEFLOW_API_KEY.
